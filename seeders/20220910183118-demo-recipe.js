Add the chipotles, chopped garlic, and bay leaves. Toss to combine. Put the skillet you used for the tomatoes on the stove over a high flame. Add the oil. When hot but not smoking, add the chicken thighs. If necessary, cook the chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. To brown well, keep the meat in a single layer and leave undisturbed for a couple of minutes before turning. Add the browned (but not cooked through) chicken to a slow cooker. Scrape all the pan juices into the pot as well. Add the tomato, onion, garlic, chipotles, and bay leaves on top. Put the lid on the slow cooker and cook on the low setting for about 6 hours. Stir the contents of the crockpot and remove the bay leaves. All the ingredients will be quite soft. As you stir, the chicken will shred. You may have to exert a little effort breaking up the tomatoes. Season the stew with a splash of vinegar and salt to taste. Serve immediately.',

If you cook the pasta until it’s ready to eat, it will likely turn mushy in the oven. Grease the dish. The pasta will stick to the bottom of the dish if you don’t. Combine the cooked macaroni, butter, cheese, salt, and pepper. Whisk together the milk and eggs. This mixture serves as the base of the sauce. When baked along with grated cheese, they turn into a thick and creamy mixture, kind of like savory custard. Pour the mixture over the macaroni. Bake the dish. It will need around 40 to 50 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Add more cheese! This step is optional, but I like to add extra cheese and broil the dish for about 3-5 minutes.

Using a plastic spatula, repeatedly slice through rice at a sharp angle to break up lumps and separate grains while very gradually pouring in vinegar mixture.

Dip fingers of one hand into a bowl of water and shake off excess. Pick up one-fourth of the rice and place across the center of the nori sheet. Spread rice evenly across the nori, leaving a 1” strip of nori on the top side uncovered. Place bamboo mat on top of rice and with the help of your cutting board, flip it, so that the nori is facing you. Place one-fourth of the cucumber, the avocado, and and the crab in an even row across center of nori, making sure the filling extends to both ends of the surface lengthwise. Starting with edge closest to you, pick up mat using thumb and index fingers of both hands; use remaining fingers to hold the filling in place as you roll mat forward and away from you. Roll forward, pressing gently but firmly. Working quickly, repeat to make a total of four rolls. Roll each in sesame seeds and slice into 8 pieces. Serve immediately with soy sauce.',
